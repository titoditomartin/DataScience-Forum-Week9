# Unsupervised Algorithms
Unsupervised learning, also referred to as unsupervised machine learning, employs algorithms to examine and categorize datasets lacking labels. These algorithms unveil concealed patterns or data clusters autonomously, without requiring human guidance.

# Summary of algorithm used
1. **K-Means Clustering:**
Purpose: Grouping data points into K distinct clusters based on similarity.
Usage: Used for segmentation and pattern recognition tasks, such as customer segmentation in marketing or image compression in computer vision.

**Hierarchical Clustering:**
Purpose: Building a hierarchy of clusters either by merging (agglomerative) or splitting (divisive) data points based on proximity.
Usage: Visualizing relationships within data through dendrograms and identifying clusters at different levels of granularity.

**DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**
Purpose: Identifying clusters based on dense regions in the data space.
Usage: Effective for discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes, handling outliers, and finding areas of varying densities.

**Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):**
Purpose: Modeling the underlying distribution of the data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Usage: Useful when data points are generated from multiple underlying probabilistic distributions and to understand the likelihood of a point belonging to a particular cluster.
